  # - ignore -> the dbt default
  # - fail -> triggers an error message, we will pick for safety since incremental processing could be expensive and time consuming to add/drop columns
  # - append_new_columns -> will only add new columns, will not drop columns
  # - sync_all_columns -> is helpful for dev, provided datasets are reasonably small, and will add and drop columns as needed

  # This controls how incremental models are sync'ed.
  # The Fullstory event pipeline is not a monotonic process (append-only);
  # therefore, merge is required on incremental models.
